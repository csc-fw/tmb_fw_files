# tmb_fw_files
Keep track of TMB (virtex2) firmware files 

- .bit file: generated by ISE from compiling the firmware 
- .mcs files: generated by impact by creating the proms files. For TMB board, there are four proms and therefore four .mcs files are generated. filename ending with 0 is for the first prom (close to FPGA after boundary scan)
- .xsvf file: generated from impact during loading mcs files into proms.  Emulib use .xsvf files to load firmware to prom
